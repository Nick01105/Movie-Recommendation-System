Movie Recommendation System: Personalized Suggestions using Hybrid Approaches
This repository contains the code and analysis for a personalized movie recommendation system, developed as part of the Foundations of Data Science (FODS) project. The system explores and compares multiple recommendation techniques, from traditional collaborative filtering to advanced hybrid and graph-based models, to find the best approach for accuracy, ranking, and diversity.

🎯 Project Objective

This project designs and develops a personalized movie recommendation system to tackle choice overload in the digital entertainment industry. The goal is to build a scalable, deployable solution that increases user satisfaction, improves content discoverability, and enhances platform engagement, similar to systems used by Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+.


The problem was framed in two parts:

Finding the models with the best predictive accuracy (RMSE, MAE).

Figuring out what influences the rank of the movies suggested (NDCG, MRR).



🛠️ Models & Approaches

This repository evaluates a wide range of recommendation algorithms on the MovieLens dataset.


Baseline Model:


Popularity-Based: Recommends movies based on the highest average rating, requiring a minimum number of reviews to qualify.

Collaborative Filtering (CF):


KNNBasic (User-based & Item-based): Generates predictions based on the ratings of similar users or items.


KNNWithMeans: An improved version of KNN that accounts for user or item rating biases by normalizing ratings.


SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): A matrix factorization technique that uncovers latent factors (hidden patterns) in the user-item interaction data.



Co-clustering: Simultaneously groups users and items into clusters to predict ratings based on group-level patterns.

Content-Based Filtering:

Uses movie genres to calculate cosine similarity between items and recommend movies similar to a user's preference.

Hybrid & Graph-Based Models (Stretch Goals):


Hybrid Model (SVD + LightGBM): Uses the latent factors generated by SVD as input features for a LightGBM (Gradient Boosting) model to predict ratings.



KGCN (Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network): A deep learning model that incorporates an external knowledge graph (e.g., connecting movies to genres and actors) to learn rich, context-aware embeddings for items.


📊 Performance & Results

Models were evaluated for both predictive accuracy (RMSE, MAE) and ranking quality (NDCG@10, MRR). The KGCN model achieved the best predictive accuracy, while the SVD model showed the strongest all-around performance, excelling in ranking metrics.


Model Performance Summary
Below is a summary of the final performance metrics. The KGCN model, implemented as a stretch goal, is included for comparison.

       Model	                  RMSE	 MAE   NDCG@10   MRR
       KGCN (Stretch Goal)	     0.849	0.643	0.765	0.858
       SVD                       0.874	0.672	0.851	0.875
       KNNWithMeans (User-based) 0.924	0.708	0.823	0.841
       KNNWithMeans (Item-based) 0.929	0.710	0.815	0.836
       Co-clustering             0.944	0.741	0.798	0.812
       KNNBasic (Item-based)     1.003	0.773	0.754	0.779
       KNNBasic (User-based)     1.021	0.787	0.731	0.755


(Metrics for all models except KGCN are from 5-fold cross-validation ).


Diversity Analysis (Stretch Goal)

We also evaluated the Intra-List Diversity (ILD) to measure how varied the recommendations are. A higher score means the recommendations are more diverse (less similar to each other).

SVD Baseline Model: ILD@10 = 0.7065

LGBM Hybrid Model: ILD@10 = 0.7391

The hybrid model not only provides strong accuracy but also recommends a more diverse set of movies, which is crucial for content discoverability and user satisfaction.

🚀 How to Run

1. Dependencies

This project uses Python 3. The main libraries can be installed via pip.


    pip install pandas numpy scikit-surprise lightgbm matplotlib seaborn requests
    pip install torch torch-geometric

Note: The scikit-surprise library requires a specific numpy version. The notebook installs 'numpy<2' to ensure compatibility.

2. Execution

The primary analysis is contained in the FODS_Assignment (2).ipynb notebook. You can run the cells sequentially to perform:

Data download and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Training and evaluation of the baseline Popularity model.

Training and evaluation of all Collaborative Filtering models (KNN, SVD, Co-clustering).

Training and evaluation of the Hybrid (SVD + LGBM) model.

Calculation of Intra-List Diversity (ILD).
